## Dynamic Pricing - ANOVA Test - Sales Simulation
##### In this project I tried to apply ANOVA Test to find out optimum price of a product across different shops and simulate sales with different prices. Our goal is to ensure the maximum profit as predicted :)Â¶
##### The data we are going to use is consist of 2 columns which are Shop_id and Price.
##### The Shop_id represents 6 different shops and price is the amount that how much a customer wish to pay for a particular Item
##### Data set is consist of survey answers taken place different shops.
